 * The Command Bus interface provides a centralized mechanism for dispatching commands to their

 * flexible command processing patterns. It manages the registration and unregistration of command
 * handlers and provides methods for sending commands to be processed by the appropriate handlers.
 *
 * <p>The command bus supports multiple handlers for a single command type, enabling cross-cutting
 * concerns like logging, validation, or notification to be handled by separate handlers.
